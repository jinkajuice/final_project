Welcome to the repo for my final project.

The experiments were conducted on two platforms:
- A machine with Apple M1 and 8GB of Memory.
- A Google Colab notebook with an L4 GPU Accelerator.

The requirements.txt is are the libraries used for all files except for 04_ series. The series 04_ notebooks were developed using google colab and it is advised that they are executed there. Required packages are included in those notebooks.

The files below are organised as follows:
- hfdata_finer / hf_data_music are the Hugging Face format datasets.
- 01_ files are the EDA notebooks.
- 02_ files are the notebooks for the BERT benchmarks.
- 03_ files are the notebooks used to run the GPT experiments.
- 04_ files are the notebooks used for the BERT experiments.
- 05_ file is the notebook used to evaluate the results.
- All other files are captures of results.
